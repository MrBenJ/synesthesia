# Synesthesia

This is my attempt to allow someone to experience [Synesthesia](https://www.wikipedia.org/Synesthesia) as I experience it while writing code.

Things that you can see:

* Pretty colors that morph and change to music!
* Top and bottom peripheral visions.
* Cool background tints.
* (Some) Shapes and colors going wild in the top and bottom.

Things beyond my current programming skill or unable to reproduce for you:

* I can't make you feel the music underneath your skin (makes you feel like you're flying and the sound is giving you a big happy hug telling you everything is going to be ok.)
* Left and right peripheral vision (tried it. Makes the browser run extremely slow)
* Sense of euphoria and uplifting nature.
* Sweating, deep breathing

MP3 included here is: **"Heavy with Hoping"** by Madeon.

## Hack with me

Make sure you have:
* Node v10+
* npm v6+
* Chrome or Chromium browser with audio context
* A great pair of headphones or speakers to listen with

To install:
* Clone this repo
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run dev` and look at `localhost:3000`.

Edit `static/script.js` and `style.scss` to play around with JS and CSS. The window will auto-reload whenever a JS change is made, and will inject new CSS whenever you edit the styling.

Hope you enjoy it!
